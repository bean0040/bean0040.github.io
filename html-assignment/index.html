            <!-- 1st paragraphs about me -->
             <p>Heya! My name is Kirk, I go by they/them or any pronouns. This is my first year at Algonquin College, which is both exciting and nerve-racking. I am new to Ottawa, I moved into residence on the 31<sup>th</sup> of August. I come from a small town called Temiskaming Shores, which is about <em>6 hours</em> north of Ottawa in northern Ontario. I'm still getting used to living on my own away from my family. Though if I'm being honest, I would prefer if I could still live with my parents, groceries are expensive.</p>

             <!-- 2nd paragraph, about my interests -->
             <p>I have a plethora of hobbies and interests, namely video games and <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&D</abbr>. Some of my favourite video games include Touhou Project, Paladins, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Game and Dead by Daylight. I absolutely love the gameplay and music from Touhou Project, in addition to the characters. In my current <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&D</abbr> campaign, my character is a bugbear bloodhunter named Aconite. Lately, I've found the easiest way to name my characters has been to name them after flowers, for example Zinnia, Poppy, Lotus and Aconite have been the most recent names.</p>
